<p><b>Integrating AI for Personalized Drug Design with Enhanced Privacy and User-Friendly Accessibility   April 2025</b></p>
<p>Worked on integrating AI into personalized drug design by combining advanced deep learning models (GNNs, transformers, diffusion models) with privacy-preserving techniques such as federated learning, differential privacy, and trusted execution environments. Designed secure, privacy-by-design architectures for handling sensitive biomedical and omics data, while developing user-friendly interfaces that made complex AI-driven drug discovery accessible to clinicians and researchers. Optimized molecular generation and candidate prioritization pipelines, contributing to faster drug discovery cycles and improved therapeutic insights. </p>
